//* Pages in the app directory in Next.js are Server Components by default; in terms of performance, it is probably the best component that can be used; advantages: dependencies can stay on the server; better performance; access to the backend
//* Server-side rendering: the client (browser) does not receive an empty html-file, but an html-file for each particular page, containing all the components, different html-elements, and different classes, already loaded on the server, that it needs; the server sends it off the the client which does not need to parse it, but can go ahead and render it.
//* A general rule: a server component can render a client component, but a client component cannot render a server component.
//* Only exception to the rule: if a client component is rendering a server component that is passed in to the client as a 'children prop'
//* `app/page.tsx` is the UI for the `/` URL
//* http://localhost:3000 / https://opentable.ca - homepage.html
import Header from './components/Header';
import RestaurantCard from './components/RestaurantCard';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Header />
      <div className="py-3 px-36 mt-10 flex flex-wrap"></div>
      <RestaurantCard />
    </main>
  );
}

//* A summary of when to use a server component and when to use a client component:
//? Fetching data: server component
//? Accessing backend resources directly: server component
//? Keeping sensitive information on the server (access tokens, API keys, etc.): server component
//? Large dependencies: keep on server component
//? Adding interactivity and event listeners (onClick, onChange): client component
//? Using state and lifecycle effects, like useState, useReducer, useEffect: client component
//? Using browser-only APIs: client component
//? Using React Class components: client component
